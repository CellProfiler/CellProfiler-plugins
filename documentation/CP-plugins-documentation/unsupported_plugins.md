# Currently Unsupported Plugins

Unsupported plugins are primarily unsupported for either of two reasons:
- They were made for a previous major version of CellProfiler and have not been updated to be compatible with the current version
- Their functions have been integrated into the current version of CellProfiler and therefore a plugin is no longer necessary

We welcome requests for updating particular unsupported plugins, but please note that we have limited bandwidth for working on plugins and may be unable to complete the update.
We welcome community contributed plugin updates.

Likewise, we welcome contributions of community developed plugins.
Please note that, because of our limited bandwidth, we cannot commit to maintaining any given plugin, CellProfiler team or community contributed.
