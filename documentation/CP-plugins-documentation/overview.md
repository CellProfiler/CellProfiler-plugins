# What are CellProfiler Plugins?

Plugins advance the capabilities of CellProfiler but are not officially supported in the same way as modules.
A module may be in CellProfiler-plugins instead of CellProfiler itself because:
- it is under active development
- it has a niche audience
- it is not documented to CellProfiler's standards
- it only works with certain version of CellProfiler
- it requires extra libraries or other dependencies we are unable or unwilling to require for CellProfiler
- it has been contributed by a community member
