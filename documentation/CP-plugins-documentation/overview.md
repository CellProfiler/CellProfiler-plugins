# What are CellProfiler Plugins?

Plugins advance the capabilities of CellProfiler but are not officially supported in the same way as modules.
Plugins can bring in bridges to other software (like ImageJ, ilastik, Cellpose, and StarDist) 
Because of this, it is necessary to install CellProfiler from source so it can interact correctly with other software


## Who made this?

CellProfiler and CellProfiler-plugins are maintained and developed in the [Cimini Lab](https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org) in the Imaging Platform at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA, USA.
