<b>CalculateMoments</b> extracts moments statistics from a given distribution of pixel values.
<hr>
This module extracts a collection of quantitative measures of the shape of a distribution of pixel values. The user can use all pixels to compute the moments or can restrict to pixels within objects. If the image has a mask, only unmasked pixels will be used.

<li><i>Standard deviation:</i> </li>
<li><i>Skewness:</i> </li>
<li><i>Kurtosis:</i> </li>

<h3>Technical notes</h3> 
<p><b>CalculateMoments</b> computes the sample mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of a collection of N pixel values denoted by x<sub>i</sub>, i=1...N as follows. 
<ul>
<li>The mean is computed according to the usual definition and is denoted by &mu.</li>
<li>The standard deviation is computed using the unbiased estimator, which is defined as <sup>1</sup>&frasl<sub>N</sub> (&sum<sub>i=1...N</sub>  (x<sub>i</sub> - &mu)<sup>2</sup> )<sup><sup>1</sup>&frasl<sub>2</sub></sup>, where &mu is the mean. It is denoted by &sigma.</li>
<li>The skewness is computed as the third moment about the mean, scaled by the standard deviation to the third power. Formally, <sup>&mu<sub>3</sub></sup>&frasl<sub>&sigma<sup>3</sup></sub>, where &sigma is the unbiased estimator of the standard deviation and &mu<sup>3</sup> is the third central moment defined as <sup>1</sup>&frasl<sub>N</sub> &sum<sub>i=1...N</sub>  (x<sub>i</sub> - &mu)<sup>3</sup>.</li>
<li>The kurtosis is computed as the fourth moment about the mean, scaled by the standard deviation to the fourth power. Formally, <sup>&mu<sub>4</sub></sup>&frasl<sub>&sigma<sup>4<sup></sub>, where &sigma is the unbiased estimator of the standard deviation and &mu<sup>4</sup> is the fourth central moment defined as <sup>1</sup>&frasl<sub>N</sub> &sum<sub>i=1...N</sub>  (x<sub>i</sub> - &mu)<sup>4</sup>.</li>
