TestAllThresholds
=================

**TestAllThresholds** is a module that allows you to test many thresholds, and pass
one forward as the finally selected method to other thresholds.

^^^^^^^^

All the thresholds here are implemented and taken from **Threshold**. 
See that module's help for more information

What do I need as input?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An input greyscale image; if you want to use a measurement to threshold on, it should be
calculated before this module (eg. calculated by MeasureImageIntensity, or loaded as a 
piece of metadata).

What do I get as output?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A thresholded image; when the eye is open, you can see the results of multiple thresholds.
You will automatically view in the display Minimum Cross Entropy, Otsu 2-class, 
Otsu 3 class (middle to foreground), and Otsu 3-class (middle to background).
You can optionally add adaptive versions of the 3 Otsus, with a specified window size.
You can also optionally add manual thresholds, measurement based thresholds, and RobustBackground.

This setting controls the scale used to smooth the input image before

The input image can be optionally smoothed before being thresholded.
Smoothing can improve the uniformity of the resulting objects, by
removing holes and jagged edges caused by noise in the acquired image.
Smoothing is most likely *not* appropriate if the input image is binary,
if it has already been smoothed or if it is an output of a pixel-based classifier.
The scale should be approximately the size of the artifacts to be
eliminated by smoothing. A Gaussian is used with a sigma adjusted so
that 1/2 of the Gaussianâ€™s distribution falls within the diameter given
by the scale (sigma = scale / 0.674)

This setting allows you to adjust the threshold as calculated by the
above method. The value entered here adjusts the threshold either
upwards or downwards, by multiplying it by this value. A value of 1
means no adjustment, 0 to 1 makes the threshold more lenient and > 1
makes the threshold more stringent.

When the threshold is calculated automatically, you may find that the value 
is consistently
too stringent or too lenient across all images. This setting is helpful
for adjusting the threshold to a value that you empirically determine is
more suitable. For example, the {Otsu automatic thresholding
inherently assumes that 50% of the image is covered by objects. If a
larger percentage of the image is covered, the Otsu method will give a
slightly biased threshold that may have to be corrected using this
setting.

Enter the minimum and maximum allowable threshold, a value from 0 to 1.
This is helpful as a safety precaution: when the threshold as calculated
automatically is clearly outside a reasonable range, the min/max allowable
threshold will override the automatic threshold.

For example, if there are no objects in the field of view, the automatic
threshold might be calculated as unreasonably low; the algorithm will
still attempt to divide the foreground from background (even though
there is no foreground), and you may end up with spurious false positive
foreground regions. In such cases, you can estimate the background pixel
intensity and set the lower bound according to this
empirically-determined value.
